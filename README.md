# TODO - no design!!!!!!!

1.  Use cache for seasons and episodes.

2.  Create episode page

## DB:

JSON - best if we need fast development and we don't realy care
or
mongoDB - best if we want to do best practice

## Cache:

redis - best if we want to store cache of data (not so good if the data is based on the user)

pages:
home
show
profile
login / register

components:
header
show (with image + favorite button + ...)
